						<h3><a href="http://www.thetalkingmachines.com">Talking Machines</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						Talking Machines is a podcast by Ryan Adams and Katherine Gorman. In each episode, they review some interesting, typically new, ideas in machine learning, answer a listener question, and interview a prominent expert in machine learning. The podcast is a great way to learn about machine learning in a less technical setting.

						<h3><a href="http://karpathy.github.io">Andrej Karpathy's Blog</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						Andrej Karpathy is a beast. He's a recent graduate from Fei Fei Li's computer vision lab at Stanford who now works at OpenAI. He's implemented various deep learning libraries for javascript, which is just insane; training a neural network through your internet browser! His work is primarily on relating images to text. He posts at least a couple in-depth blog posts each year, doing an excellent job of implementing and explaining important concepts in deep learning.

						<h3><a href="http://blog.shakirm.com">Shakir Mohamed's Blog: The Spectator</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						Shakir Mohamed is a research scientist at DeepMind and an expert in combining deep learning with probabilistic graphical models. His work is often quite technical, but his blog is accessible to experts and novices alike. Similar to myself, he is intersested in finding the relationships between computation in biological and machine systems.

						<h3><a href="http://colah.github.io">Chris Olah's Blog</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						Chris Olah is a bit of a legend. He was awarded a Thiel Fellowship, which encourages its recipients to drop out of college to instead start companies or pursue research (in the style of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs). He's been working on deep learning for the past few years, with an emphasis on network visualization. His blog is an excellent resource for learning all of the fundamentals in deep learning. Be sure to check out his posts on recurrent networks!

						<h3><a href="https://research.googleblog.com">Google Research Blog</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						The Google research blog is a showcasing of technical, yet practical, work. Many of the blog posts relate to machine learning and deep learning in some way. Definitely worth bookmarking.
						</i>
						</p>

						<hr />

						<h3><a href="https://openai.com/blog/">OpenAI's Blog</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						OpenAI's blog gives an overview of recent research efforts within the organization. The blog posts provide a nice way of getting exposed to recent research in a more casual setting.
						</i>
						</p>
						<hr />

					<h3><a href="https://research.facebook.com/blog/ai/">Facebook AI Research Blog</a></h3>

						<p>
						<i>
						This list wouldn't be complete without FAIR's research blog. Like other company research blogs, they give an overview of their recent projects.
