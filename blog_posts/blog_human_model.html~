						<h3> Preface </h3>

						<p>
						I have decided to take a different direction with this blog post. Rather than delve into the technical details of a particular model or algorithm, I want to briefly discuss some <i>philosophical</i> thoughts I've had recently. I think a lot about how to apply insights from what we know about biological intelligence to build machine intelligence. However, the insights often flow equally well in the opposite direction: machine learning often recasts findings from neuroscience in a grounded and principled way. The following is a short discussion about what machine learning can teach us about ourselves and how we learn. Now, I'm sure you're sitting there thinking, "Give me break, machine learning can't teach us anything about ourselves!" Nevertheless, I hope you find this post thought-provoking, or entertaining at the very least.
						</p>

						<p>
As a student of machine learning and deep learning, I train models for a living. Whether it's fitting a line to a set of points, learning a latent representation, or classifying images, <b>to perfom any task, you need a model</b>. Machine learning researchers are constantly inventing new models and tweaks to existing models, each promising to solve new tasks, use less data, or be easier to train. It's been thrilling to see the ideas that have come out of this AI spring that we find ourselves in. Yet, even with the multitude of approaches out there, <b>there are some basic, core commonalities to all models</b>. These are principles that apply to the field of machine learning as a whole, and as I'll argue, many of these principles apply to biological learning as well.
						</p>

						<h3> Got data? </h3>

						<p>
						One thing that became apparent to me when I started working in machine learning was the fact that  
						</p>

						<center><h2>a model is only as good as its <u>priors</u> and the <u>data</u> that it's trained on.</h2></center>

						<p>
						Look past the obviousness of this statement for a moment and give it some real thought. Imagine that you've just come up with the most amazing model ever created. You either need 1) a great set of priors on your model and its parameters, in which case you've likely done some form of learning beforehand, or 2) the data required to train the model. Unless you have both of these, your model is worthless: you won't be able to use it. It'll just sit in its directory on your hard disk, collecting dust. 
						</p>

						<p>
						This general idea, highlighting the importance of data and priors for a well-performing system, also applies to biological systems. We might not look or feel like it, but you and I are both, in some sense, very specialized, complex models of our environments. We're constantly taking in data through our senses, processing and learning from this data, and producing outputs in the form of actions. Each of us also has a set of priors on our nervous systems, 'learned' through the process of evolution. These are akin to blueprints that specify the overall architecture and functional parts of your nervous system, but typically not the specific way in which things fit together. We are a combination of <em>nature</em>, from our biological priors, and <em>nurture</em>, from the data we encounter.
						</p>


						<center><h2>We are all models of our environments.</h2></center>

						<p>
						So what does this say about us? It says that who we are as individuals is shaped by our surroundings. Your personality, quality of character, views and opinions, talents and skills and everything you're capable of is a result of the data that you, as well as your ancestors, encountered in the environment. Or conversely, without that data from our environments, we wouldn't be us. Our surroundings shape us.
						</p>

						<p>
						Now, it's difficult to know what makes for a 'great' human. That's too subjective to even begin to measure. We're no longer judged solely on the basis of our ability to procreate. However, I will go as far as to say this: much of what we admire in other people, such as leadership, intelligence, skill, and perhaps even qualities such as compassion and determination, are learned. Improving oneself requires the right data, as well as effort in the form of learning. This is often summarized in the phrase: <b>"heroes aren't born, they're made."</b> (Or alternatively, learned/learnt).
						</p>
                        
						<h3> Active Learners </h3>

						<p>
						Unlike machine learning models, we, as humans, largely have control over the data that we encounter and learn from. Nobody is forcing you to memorize MNIST or ImageNet. Nobody is forcing you to learn how to play Atari or Go. Nobody is forcing you to paint realistic paintings or reconstruct ones you've already seen. Instead, we force children to spend roughly the first two decades of their lives internalizing basic knowledge about language, math, history, art, etc. This education is obviously important, as it gives individuals the tools necessary to contribute to society and enrich their own lives as well.
						</p>

						<p>
						However, what we often fail to realize is that learning is a lifelong process. Furthermore, learning is not restricted to teachers, textbooks, and tests. Learning can (and should) be an <em>active</em> process, whereby the learner seeks out data in an attempt to improve him or herself and their model of the world. We should all strive to seek out new experiences, push ourselves to understand the world and each other, and find meaning in life. You only live once (YOLO); 
						
						</p>

						<center><h2>you may as well be the best model... I mean person... that you can be!</h2></center>

						<h3> The Takeaway </h3>
						<p>
						You're a model of your environment; your brain processes all of the incoming data around you. If you feed your brain the same patterns day after day, you'll never be challenged to grow as a person. You'll continually fall into the same thought processes. You'll overfit to the data that you've already seen. So break out of your established routines! Feed your brain the data that it craves! Go explore the world! Go strike up a conversation with a stranger! Try something new! Cooking, art, a sport, volunteering, anything! Your brain will thank you.
