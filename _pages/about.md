I am a Researcher at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/en/). My work focuses on time series analysis in financial applications.
In addition to time-series analysis, I'm also interested in deep generative models, especially automatic structured representation learning by combining deep learning, probabilistic graphical models and information theory.
