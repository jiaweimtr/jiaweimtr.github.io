I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Vision and Machine Learning Lab](http://vml.cs.sfu.ca) at Simon Fraser University (SFU) and a Research Engineer at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/en/). I am supervised by Professor [Greg Mori](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/). I also work closely with Professor [Leonid Sigal](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lsigal/index.html) (UBC), Professor [Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com) (UCI), Dr. [Andreas Lehrmann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=DM49PecAAAAJ&hl=en)(Borealis AI), Dr. [Cheng Zhang](https://cheng-zhang.org) (Microsoft Research) and [Joe Marino](https://joelouismarino.github.io) (CalTech).

My focus is on statistical machine learning and deep generative models, especially automatic structured representation learning by combining deep learning, probabilistic graphical models and information theory. I'm also interested in applying such model to practical scenarios including computer vision and financial applications.
